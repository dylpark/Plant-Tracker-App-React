    info: "The paddle plant is a bold succulent that has big, round leaves with pink tips. These plants favor bright light so you can have it sit right on a sunny windowsill to soak in all the rays. These also like to be on the drier side, so don’t worry if you forget to water from time to time — they can take it!",
